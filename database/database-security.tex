\section{\noun{Data Encryption}}

\begin{packed_enum}
	\item Hard disks, on which are stored databases, will be encrypted by external program TrueCrypt. TrueCrypt encrypts whole data on hard disk in real time. 
	\item Databases will be encrypted by TDE (Transparent Data Encryption). TDE encrypts:
        \begin{packed_enum}
			\item Database files
			\item Database Snapshots
			\item Transaction Log File
            \item Backups
		\end{packed_enum}
	using DEK ( Database Encryption Key ) which is protected by certificate.
\end{packed_enum}

\section{\noun{Backup Procedure}}
\begin{packed_enum}
	\item To ensure no data loss, database is replicated in real-time to a server in another location - this location meets conditions mentioned in section 5.1.
	\item Additionally, regular backups are made every day.
	\item Backups are kept for reasonable amount of time:
        \begin{packed_enum}
			\item Daily backups - 1 week
			\item Weekly backups - 1 month
			\item Monthly backups - 1 year
			\item Annual backups - forever
